The following are my reflections: 

* Were your predictions accurate?

Yes, my predictions were mostly accurate. I guessed that "Hiking" would be the most enjoyable activity, which was correct. I also predicted that "creative" would be the most common category, which was also correct. I thought evening activities might be more enjoyable, but not always.

 What surprised you about your week?

I was surprised by how many activities I did in the morning. I usually think of myself as a night owl, but I had a lot of enjoyable moments earlier in the day too. 

* Which higher-order function was most useful and why?

The filter method was the most useful. It helped me find patterns in my week, like low-effort, high-enjoyment activities.
